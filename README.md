# BitShift-Variations-unrolled
This is Rob Miles Bitshift Variations code unrolled so we can understand how it works. It's based on his original code, published here:

http://txti.es/bitshiftvariationsincminor

and which I have started to "unroll" or format for human reading here:

https://github.com/JamesNewton/BitShift-Variations-unrolled/blob/master/code

This is amazingly cool code! 

1. Compact (part of a competition to write a working program in the fewest possible characters) 

2. Artistic (the output is actually rather nice... given time) 

3. Descriptive (it embodies fundamental rules of a completely different area of study). 

What does it do? It makes music. In that amazingly short program are a basic set of rules of good sounding music, including the waveform, notes, chords, and tempos. Looks like gobbly gook. Makes passable music. Amazing. Here is at least 16 minutes of it (the actual program will keep going forever, although it repeats at some, yet unknown, point). It starts slow, but gets going in under a minute.

For a few notes on how it works (beyond the [source code](https://github.com/JamesNewton/BitShift-Variations-unrolled/blob/master/code)) see the local [wiki](https://github.com/JamesNewton/BitShift-Variations-unrolled/wiki)

"Let's all" fork this to continue to "unroll" it and document how it works!

If you haven't used github... well... A) you should, and B) this is a great place to start. Git can be very very scary and complex, but getting started is easy: If you see some change you could make to the "code" file listed above, then

- Sign in or sign up for github.
- Fork the project. (Hit the "Fork" button, upper right corner)
- Open the file "code" in your fork (click the file name "code" on the left)
- Edit the file to make your changes (pencil icon next to trash icon)
- When you are done editing, Commit your changes (scroll down, click Commit)
- Make a pull request. (green and white "New Pull Request" button.)
- Assuming your branch is now different from mine (because you commited a change) you should be able to "Create Pull Requst"
- I get the pull request and approve it, which makes your changes the current "head" on this project and future forks. 

This is using Github without installing Git on your local machine. It's quick, pretty easy, and... collaboration is fun and useful and worth learning to do. If you want to really get into it, start here:
